# Privacy Policy for OwnAI

**Last Updated:** [Date You Finalize This Policy]

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to OwnAI! This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use the OwnAI macOS application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This App is designed to operate with your privacy as a priority.

## 2. Information We Handle

The App primarily works with information you provide and stores it locally on your device.
There is no data transfer to the creators of the app.

**a. Locally Stored Configuration Data:**

The App stores the following settings locally on your macOS device using standard macOS storage mechanisms (such as UserDefaults, managed via AppStorage in SwiftUI). This data is stored solely for the App's functionality and your convenience:

*   **Ollama Server Address:** The network address of the Ollama server you configure.
*   **Ollama Server Port:** The port number for the Ollama server you configure.
*   **Selected Model Name:** The name of the Ollama model you select for use.
*   **Appearance Settings:** Preferences such as chat font size, code font size, and line spacing.

**We, the developers of OwnAI, do not have access to, collect, or transmit this locally stored configuration data. It remains on your device.**

**b. Information Transmitted to Your Ollama Server:**

The App connects directly to the Ollama server address and port that **you provide** in the settings. This communication is necessary for the App to:

*   Test the connection to your Ollama server.
*   Fetch a list of available models from your Ollama server.
*   (If applicable to the broader app functionality) Send requests and receive responses from your Ollama server for chat interactions.

**OwnAI does not control the Ollama server you connect to. You are responsible for the privacy and security of your own Ollama instance and any data it may collect or log according to its own configuration and policies.**

**c. No Personal Data Collected by the Developer:**

Beyond the locally stored settings described above, OwnAI does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, analytics, or tracking data about you or your usage of the App.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

OwnAI does not share any of your information with third parties.

The only "sharing" of data that occurs is when the App communicates directly with the Ollama server **you have configured**, as described in section 2b. This is not sharing with an external third party from the perspective of the App's developer, but rather a direct interaction between the App (acting on your behalf) and your own server.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

All configuration data used by OwnAI is stored locally on your macOS device. You have control over this data:

*   You can view and modify these settings directly within the App.
*   You can typically remove this data by deleting the App and its associated preference files from your system.

While we strive to build a secure application, the security of the data stored on your local device and the security of your Ollama server are your responsibilities.

## 5. Children's Privacy

OwnAI is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We may also provide notice through the App or its App Store page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our information practices.
